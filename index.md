### Biography
I am currently an Honorary Visiting Fellow in the Centre for Systems Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Behavior and Psychology, University of Leicester, UK, under the supervision of Dr. Jian K. Liu. I am also a PhD candidate (2019-2020 is my fifth year in a five-year phd program) of the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China, supervised by Prof. Gang Pan.

### Research Intersets
My research interesets include computational neuroscience, brain/biology-inspired computing, neuromorphic computing. In particular, during my whole PhD program, I have made 4 projects. First, for a neuromorphic chip, I am responsible for designing and implementing spiking neural networks (SNNs) algorithms on neuromorphic chip (ZJU-Darwin). Second, I focused on high-performance computing on resource-constraint devices including large-scale network pruning, quantizing and regularization. Meanwhile mapping these light-weight networks on different devices. Third, combined neuroscience and artificial intelligence, I paid attention to brain/biology-inspired computing. Fourth, I am interested in systems neuroscience, to be more specific, exploring neural dynamics in single biological neuron or classes of neurons.
